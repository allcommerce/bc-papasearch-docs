- **Poor Quality Results:** Increase threshold gradually
- **Missing Relevant Results:** Decrease threshold carefully

### Search Behavior Settings

**Default Sort Options:**
- **Relevance:** Search algorithm ranking (recommended)
- **Newest:** Most recently added products first
- **Price (Low to High):** Ascending price order
- **Price (High to Low):** Descending price order
- **Name (A-Z):** Alphabetical ascending
- **Name (Z-A):** Alphabetical descending

**Search Result Limits:**
- **Products Per Page:** Default number of products displayed
- **Maximum Results:** Upper limit for search result pages
- **Performance Impact:** Lower limits improve loading speed
- **User Experience:** Balance between performance and completeness
