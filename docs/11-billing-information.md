## Legal & Compliance

### Tax and Legal Requirements

Your billing information is used to comply with various tax and business laws. Company names and addresses are legally required on business invoices in most jurisdictions. For EU businesses, providing a valid VAT ID enables the reverse charge mechanism, which can exempt you from paying VAT on B2B transactions. Your billing address determines which tax laws apply to your transactions and helps calculate the correct tax rates.

We retain your billing information for tax audit and compliance purposes, typically for seven years as required by most tax authorities. This helps both you and us maintain proper records for potential tax audits or regulatory inquiries.

### Your Data Protection Rights

Under data protection laws like GDPR (for EU customers) and CCPA (for California residents), you have specific rights regarding your personal information. This includes the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. We use your billing information solely for billing, invoicing, and tax compliance purposes - never for marketing or other unrelated activities.

Your billing data is never shared with third parties for marketing purposes. We may verify your information against business registration databases to authenticate your account and prevent fraud, but this is done solely for security and compliance reasons.

### Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for providing accurate and current billing information. If your business details change, you should update this information promptly to ensure continued compliance with tax laws and proper invoice generation.

For specific questions about VAT ID requirements or tax compliance, we recommend consulting with your tax advisor, as tax laws vary by jurisdiction and can be complex. While we provide the tools to collect and store your billing information securely, compliance with local tax and business laws remains your responsibility.
