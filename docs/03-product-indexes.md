## Best Practices for Index Management

### Regular Maintenance Schedule

#### Daily (Automated if possible):
- Sync new & modified products
- Check for any failed products
- Monitor sync status

#### Weekly:
- Review outdated products
- Clean up discontinued products
- Check sync performance

#### Monthly:
- Full reindex of all products
- Review product performance in search
- Optimize based on search analytics

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Catalogs (>5,000 products):
1. Schedule syncs during low-traffic hours
2. Use incremental syncs instead of full reindex
3. Monitor server resources during sync
4. Consider breaking large operations into batches

#### For Small Catalogs (<1,000 products):
1. Full reindex is usually quick and safe
2. Can sync more frequently
3. Real-time updates are more feasible

### Data Quality Tips

1. **Keep BigCommerce data clean**: Accurate product info improves search
2. **Use consistent naming**: Helps with search relevance
3. **Maintain good SKUs**: Useful for tracking and debugging
4. **Regular price updates**: Keep pricing current in search
5. **Product descriptions**: Rich descriptions improve AI search quality
