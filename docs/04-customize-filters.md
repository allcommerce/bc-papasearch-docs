## Filter Visibility and Behavior

### Visibility Settings Explained

#### Visible Filters
- **Appear on**: Category pages, search results
- **Customer interaction**: Can be used to narrow results
- **Performance impact**: Minimal for most filter types
- **SEO benefit**: May help with search engine optimization

#### Hidden Filters
- **Not displayed**: Customers cannot see or use them
- **Background processing**: May still be calculated for performance
- **Use cases**: Filters with insufficient data, testing new filters
- **Temporary**: Can be enabled when ready

### Advanced Visibility Options

Some filters may have additional visibility options:

#### Conditional Visibility
- **Based on**: Number of products, user groups, or other criteria
- **Example**: Only show "Size" filter if products have size options
- **Smart hiding**: Automatically hide filters with only one option

#### Channel-Specific Visibility
- **Purpose**: Different filters for different sales channels
- **Use case**: B2B vs B2C filtering needs
- **Management**: Set per channel in advanced settings

## Filter Performance and Optimization

### Understanding Filter Impact

#### Performance Considerations:
- **More filters**: Slightly slower page loading
- **Complex filters**: Custom fields may load slower than simple ones
- **Large catalogs**: Filter calculation takes more time
- **Cache benefits**: Filters are cached for better performance

#### Optimization Tips:
1. **Show relevant filters only**: Hide unused filters
2. **Logical order**: Put popular filters first
3. **Reasonable limits**: Don't show too many options at once
4. **Regular cleanup**: Remove filters with no products

### Filter Loading States

#### Initial Page Load:
- **Basic filters**: Load immediately
- **Dynamic filters**: May load slightly after page
- **User feedback**: Loading indicators show progress

#### After Filter Selection:
- **Product updates**: Results refresh automatically
- **URL updates**: Filter state saved in browser
- **History**: Back button works correctly
