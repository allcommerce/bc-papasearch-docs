## Understanding User Search Data

### What Are User Search Keywords?

User Search Keywords are the actual terms customers type into your search box. Unlike suggested keywords (which you manage), these represent real customer behavior and provide invaluable insights into:

- What customers are actually looking for
- How they describe your products
- Common search patterns and trends
- Gaps between what you offer and what customers want
- Opportunities for product sourcing and keyword optimization

- Identify product categories in high demand
- Understand seasonal search patterns
- Discover new market opportunities

**Search Experience Optimization**
- Find searches that return poor results
- Identify common misspellings or variations
- Optimize suggested keywords based on real data
